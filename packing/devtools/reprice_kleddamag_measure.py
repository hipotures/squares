"""Re-price the external ``n = 17`` Kleddamag measure on its own final catalogue.

The retained artifact under ``packing/resources/web/n17-kleddamag-certified-bound-2026-09-21/``
carries a measure whose slack distribution is strongly bimodal: 5,222 of its 7,853
catalogue rows clear ``1.00207``, 2,140 of them share one identical minimum, and the
global minimum ``1.000020517`` is attained by a single row. A measure whose row minima
pile up on one plateau is a measure that was priced against an *earlier* catalogue and
never re-priced against the one row generation finished on. That is headroom at fixed
``(L, A)`` on the existing support, and this tool measures how much of it there is.

The measurement is a covering linear program on the artifact's own support:

* **Variables.** The 1,134 point-orbit weights and the 253 two-of-three orbit weights,
  1,387 in all, non-negative. Every orbit is a variable, the 282 that the artifact prices
  at zero included, because re-pricing is free to turn one on.
* **Constraints.** One per catalogue row, at the *cell where that row's charge is least*.
  The artifact's own sweep reports each row's minimum; this tool reports where it is
  attained. Each extracted cell contributes ``sum_o a_o w_o + sum_s b_s w_s >= 1``, with
  ``a_o`` the number of that orbit's sites the row's core captures at that centre and
  ``b_s`` the number of that orbit's triples with at least two of three captured.
* **Objective.** The measure's own budget, ``sum_o |orbit_o| w_o + sum_s |triples_s| w_s``,
  which is exactly how the artifact totals ``budget_units``.

**The value this returns is a lower bound on a re-priced measure's mass, not a
certificate.** The constraint set is one cell per row, and a real certificate has to hold
over the whole continuum of every row -- every cell, not the least one. Dropping the
other cells enlarges the feasible set, so the optimum can only fall: the number below is
a *relaxation* of the re-pricing problem. An LP value under 17 therefore does not say a
certificate exists at this ``(L, A)``; it says nothing at all is ruled out yet, and the
next rung is a separation loop that puts the violated cells back. An LP value at or above
the artifact's own normalised mass says the opposite and says it conclusively, because a
relaxation that cannot go below a number proves the unrelaxed problem cannot either.

The translation from the artifact's bytes is not re-done here.
`devtools.translate_kleddamag_certificate` owns it, with the nine controls that prove it
preserves the object, and this module imports `read_source` and `expand` from it rather
than reading the source a second way.
What is new here is the *argmin*: the artifact's checker reports each row's least charge
and throws away the cell, so the cell is recovered by a second sweep with the same
rectangles, the same event grid and the same restricted legal-centre polygon.

The controls, all exact:

``K1`` every extracted cell's charge under the artifact's own weights, recomputed from
the extracted capture set, against the artifact's retained per-row replay
(`evidence/average4-adaptive-r1.python-replay.json`) -- the minimum, row by row, over
every row swept. A capture set that is off by one site fails this.
``K2`` the slab and cell counts of this sweep against the same replay, row by row.
Agreeing on the cell counts is the sharp half: a differently partitioned sweep would not.
``K3`` this sweep's ``(units, slabs, cells)`` against
`translate_kleddamag_certificate.restricted_row_minimum`, the translator's own
implementation, on a sample of rows -- a third implementation of the same number.
``K4`` the artifact's own weights evaluated through the emitted constraint matrix: the
objective must return ``budget_units`` and the least constraint value must return
``minimum_units``, so the LP's own arithmetic reproduces the artifact before it is asked
to improve on it. This makes the artifact a *feasible point* of the relaxation, which is
what makes ``budget_units / minimum_units`` the number the LP value is read against.
``K5`` every extracted centre tested against its own row's legal-centre polygon, exactly.
The sweep's slab window is a superset of the polygon -- it admits any cell the polygon
*meets* -- so a cell on the boundary can have a midpoint outside it. Those rows are
counted and reported; a constraint at an illegal centre would make the LP value an
overstatement, which is the direction that matters for a negative verdict.
``K6`` the LP solution rationalised on the artifact's own weight denominator and
re-verified exactly: the reported mass is ``objective / least charge`` in integers, so it
is the exact mass of an exactly feasible rational measure and never a solver's float.
