"""Translate the external n = 17 Kleddamag measure into this repository's threshold schema.

The retained artifact under `packing/resources/web/n17-kleddamag-certified-bound-2026-09-21/`
carries a weighted covering measure -- 1,134 point orbits and 253 two-of-three orbits over
the container ``L = 4613/1000`` -- stated in a *restricted parent-centre* language this
repository does not implement. Its catalogue assigns to every parent half-angle interval
``[a, b]`` a concentric core ``(t, B)`` and then quantifies only over centres a legal
side-``A`` parent could have, the square ``[r, L - r]^2`` with
``r = A min(c(a) + s(a), c(b) + s(b)) / 2``. Nothing in this repository registers that
statement, and the two-route gate cannot read it.

This tool restates the *same measure* in the unrestricted language of
`sqpack.fractional.threshold`: the point orbits expanded to their D4 sites as point atoms,
the two-of-three orbits expanded to their physical triples as ``2``-of-``3`` threshold
atoms, one shrink ``B`` for every direction, and a uniform half-tangent net. Nothing about
the parent survives the translation, so ``Condition 5'`` then quantifies over *every*
closed ``B``-square at a net direction inside the container -- a strict superset of the
artifact's centres, since ``B <= A`` and each row's own check
``B (c(t) + s(t)) / 2 <= r`` puts the core's envelope inside the parent's. A pass would
therefore hand the repository the external bound in its own gate, and that implication is
one-sided in the useful direction.

A *fail* is weaker than it looks, and the difference matters enough to state here. The
whole-net decision replaces the artifact's adaptive per-row selector -- a core angle within
``0.006`` degrees of its parent band, a per-row ``B`` anywhere in the measured band -- with
fixed net directions and one ``B``, so it varies the selector and the net alongside the
domain. Its least charge is an *upper bound* on what the parent-centre restriction costs
and never a measurement of it. The measurement is ``--charge-at`` below, which moves the
centre and nothing else. Neither reading is worth anything if the translation moved the
object, which is what the controls below are for.

Three choices in the translation, each of which could be made differently and none of
which is free:

* **``B`` is the smallest core side in the catalogue**, ``min`` over the 7,853 rows, because
  the schema carries one shrink and the row-wise guarantee is only as strong as its weakest
  core. Smaller ``B`` captures fewer sites, so this is the conservative reading of
  ``Condition 5'`` and simultaneously the sharper one for the dilation corollary, whose
  supremum ``L sqrt(1 + D^2) / (B (1 + D))`` falls as ``B`` rises.
* **``L`` is the artifact's own container side, unscaled.** The emitted record therefore
  claims ``s(17) >= 4613/1000``, which is *below* the registered ``T-032``; the external
  value is recovered only through `devtools.dilation_corollary`, exactly as ``A1``'s row in
  X-041 sets out. Scaling the sites by ``1 / A`` instead would put ``B / A`` past what
  ``Condition 4`` admits on any net this repository runs.
* **Zero-weight sites are not emitted as point atoms.** All 2,244 of them are triple sites,
  so every one of them still reaches the event grid through its threshold atom, and the
  charge function is unchanged site for site. The emitted atom list is the 6,744 sites of
  positive weight.

The controls, all exact, all decided before a byte is written:

``C1`` the expanded structure -- 8,988 sites, 6,744 of them positive, 852 positive orbits,
2,008 physical triples -- against the artifact's own retained `evidence/structure.json`;
``C2`` every site distinct and inside the container;
``C3`` every point orbit a full D4 orbit of one weight, and every threshold orbit a full D4
orbit of triples, re-derived here rather than read from the file;
``C4`` the point budget, the triple budget and their total against ``budget_units``;
``C5`` the artifact's own counting inequality ``17 * minimum_units > budget_units``;
``C6`` the emitted atoms closed under `sqpack.fractional.certificate.d4_images` at equal
weight, which is the gate's own ``Condition 1`` predicate, decided here so the gate is not
the first thing to see it;
``C7`` ``B (1 + D) < 1`` at the requested net, which is ``Condition 4``;
``C8`` -- the one that matters -- the artifact's own per-row minima, recomputed *from the
expanded sites* over the artifact's own restricted centre domain and required to match the
retained Python replay exactly, row by row, on the minimum, the slab count and the cell
count. The row attaining the global minimum is always in the sample, so ``C8`` reproduces
``minimum_units`` itself. A translation that cannot do that has moved the object and no
unrestricted verdict taken from it means anything; the tool refuses to emit.

``C8`` is a second implementation of the artifact's sweep, not a call into its checker: a
segment-free slab sweep over the same signed rectangle expansion
``1[i + j + k >= 2] = ij + ik + jk - 2ijk``, in ``int64`` under the artifact's own
``sum(w) + 5 sum(w_triple) < 2^50`` headroom, with the polygon crossings taken in exact
integer arithmetic. It agrees with the retained replay on the cell counts as well as the
minima, which a differently-partitioned sweep would not.

Three measurements ride on the same expansion, each behind its own flag because each
costs something:

``--charge-at`` (``C9``) charges one catalogue row's *own* core -- its own ``t``, its own
``B``, the artifact's own sites -- at one named centre, by membership counting in exact
rationals. It is the un-confounded reading of what the parent-centre restriction carries,
because it moves the centre and nothing else; the whole-net decision below moves the
domain, the selector and the net together and can only bound it.

``--point-only-rows`` is the ``H-235`` screen: the same restricted rows with every
two-of-three atom dropped, deciding whether the triples are load-bearing at these weights.

``--sweep-certificate`` with ``--sweep-directions`` decides ``Condition 5'`` at a sample of
an emitted record's own net directions, reading the bytes through
`devtools.decide_threshold_certificate`'s loader and running that gate's own exact sweep.
``Condition 5'`` is a conjunction over directions, so a sample refuses and never accepts;
it exists because the whole net is hours of gate at this support size and a lane that only
needs to refuse should not pay for them.
