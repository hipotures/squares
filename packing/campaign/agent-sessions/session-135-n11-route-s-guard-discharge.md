  branch: codex/n11-route-s-admission
  primary_bead: think-r55v
  status: stopped
  goal: >-
    Discharge the four source-distinct Route S admission guards, preserve a target-blind
    exact replay boundary, and either admit the instrument or retain a precise refusal
    without running a compression target.
  budget:
    wall_minutes: 120
    max_cycles: 3
    orientation_minutes: 10
    checkpoint_minutes: 35
    slice_minutes: 70
    finalization_minutes: 30
  stop_conditions:
  - >-
    Run no optimizer, coverage target, candidate certificate, or scientific experiment;
    do not allocate exp-161.
  - >-
    Pin the T-025 control and both T-026 sentinels outside the mutable admission record,
    and refuse any mismatch before deriving an admission receipt.
  - >-
    Admit only a canonical, source-bound, nonempty selection-manifest codec whose
    full-control and 23-orbit boundary cases round-trip through the existing loader.
  - >-
    Exercise every mutation class named by X-032 and require a source-distinct review
    before changing H-163 instrument readiness or the receipt status.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: pipeline-improvement
    focus: correctness
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    commitment: BC-343
    bead: think-r55v
    objective: >-
      Bind complete repository-owned source contents to a declared Git revision and
      path, integrate both T-026 sentinels, and complete the X-032 mutation matrix.

    deadline_at: '2026-09-15T20:51:20Z'
    expected_output: >-
      A target-blind Route S admission surface whose retained receipt is deterministic,
      whose four prior blockers are absent, and whose focused and records checks pass.
    validation_command: >-
      cd packing && uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev pytest -q
      tests/test_threshold_compression.py tests/test_admit_threshold_compression.py &&
      uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev packing-validate --records
    kill_condition: >-
      Stop and retain a blocked checkpoint if any source cannot be reproduced in full
      from its declared Git revision and path, either sentinel is unbound, the manifest
      has an ambiguous canonical form, a named mutation can pass, or the phase deadline
      arrives before source-distinct review.
    fallback: >-
      Preserve the smallest checked primitives, record the exact surviving guard, and
      leave PR 182 draft with H-163 instrument_ready false.
    outcome: >-
      The admitted boundary now binds every frozen source outside its mutable record,
      authenticates both T-026 sentinels, round-trips one canonical manifest through the
      existing certificate loader, and executes the complete target-blind mutation and
      23/24 policy controls. A source-distinct audit found one symlink-alias bypass; the
      repaired path boundary and regression passed re-audit with no remaining finding.

    - packing/src/sqpack/fractional/threshold_compression.py
    - packing/devtools/admit_threshold_compression.py
    stop_reason: >-
      All declared guards passed before the phase deadline. The phase stops with
      exact-head certification pending under think-so4g and does not cross into
      experiment registration or target execution.
    next_action: >-
      Certify and merge the exact admitted PR head under think-so4g, then plan a separate
      exp-161 branch before any target access.
  progress:
    metric: >-
      Four source-distinct admission guards discharged without executing a scientific
      target.
    before: >-
      PR 182 is a green, blocked checkpoint with exact orbit primitives, but it
      self-attests some digests, binds only the 1440-step sentinel, lacks a canonical
      selection-manifest codec, and does not exercise every X-032 mutation class.
    after: >-
      The target-blind Route S instrument is admitted after source-distinct review. Its
      deterministic receipt binds T-025 and both T-026 sentinels, the canonical manifest,
      the full mutation matrix, and the 23/24 boundary. H-163 is open and untested;
      exp-161 remains unallocated and the n=11 frontier is unchanged.
  delegations:
  - task: Implement the canonical source-bound selection-manifest codec and core mutations.
    operator: Codex core-codec sub-agent
    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    outcome: >-
      Added one byte-canonical, catalogue-bound manifest for nonempty positive orbit
      selections. Full-control, mixed 23-orbit, and 24-orbit boundary manifests pass
      through the same parser; malformed manifests are refused before decompression.

    - Scoped Ruff and BasedPyright pass with zero findings.
    uncertainty: >-
      X-032 now resolves the earlier all-zero ambiguity explicitly: omission represents
      zero, and a manifest remains nonempty because N+ = 0 has no finite compression
      factor and cannot be a candidate certificate.

      Bound T-025 and both T-026 sources by complete-content comparison at one declared
      Git revision and repository-relative path, authenticated both corollaries,

      Found one in-repository symlink alias that bypassed the intended no-alias file-open

# Session 135: N11 Route S Guard Discharge

This target-blind session admits the Route S instrument after an independent review and
one repaired path-alias finding.
It does not establish that a compressed certificate exists, covers the domain, or
improves any bound. PR 182 merged the certified instrument as `1d9c49c4` from reviewed
head `609d7d62`. A separate registered experiment under `think-ufmk` owns any target
work.
