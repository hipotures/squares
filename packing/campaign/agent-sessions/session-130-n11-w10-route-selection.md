  title: N11 W10 Route Selection
  date: '2026-09-14'
  started_at: '2026-09-14T23:15:00Z'
  deadline_at: '2026-09-15T00:45:00Z'
  ended_at: '2026-09-14T23:31:17Z'
  branch: codex/n11-w10-route-selection
  primary_bead: think-9y7p
  status: stopped
  certification_pending: think-9y7p
  goal: >-
    Reconstruct whether OR-12 makes the W5 checkpoint due, review the recent merged
    stack for stability, compare every audited mathematical route on one common frame,
    and select exactly one next bounded entry without running it.
  resource_usage_unmeasured:
    reason: native_harness_data_unavailable
    detail: >-
      The collaboration harness exposed the three delegated reviews but no native
      task-tree resource receipt or log identifier from which a repository roll-up can
      be generated.
    disposition_bead: think-9y7p
    handoff_role: work_handoff
  budget:
    wall_minutes: 90
    max_cycles: 3
    orientation_minutes: 10
    checkpoint_minutes: 30
    slice_minutes: 60
    finalization_minutes: 20
  stop_conditions:
  - >-
    The latest qualifying W5 and the subsequent substantive block count are derived
    from durable records, with ambiguous administrative or overlapping work treated
    conservatively.
  - >-
    Each scientific candidate has an explicit continue, pause, or stop disposition,
    and exactly one next entry is selected.
  - >-
    The planning result runs no efficiency repair and no scientific target; each later
    block receives its own branch and pull request.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: review-planning-oversight
    focus: process
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    commitment: BC-346
    bead: think-9y7p
    objective: >-
      Derive the efficiency cadence, verify the recent merge boundary, compare the ten
      scientific candidates and the due checkpoint, and publish one executable next
      entry with the remaining portfolio explicitly disposed.
    status: stopped
    entered_by: session_start
    switch_reason: null
    budget_minutes: 70
    started_at: '2026-09-14T23:15:00Z'
    deadline_at: '2026-09-15T00:25:00Z'
    expected_output: >-
      A source-bound W10 decision review, corrected cadence metadata, synchronized
      agenda and synopsis state, and one unambiguous handoff.
    validation_command: >-
      cd packing && env PYTHON_CPU_COUNT=4
      DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/cairo/lib uv run --frozen
      --all-extras --group dev packing-validate --fast --jobs 3 --inner-jobs 1
    kill_condition: >-
      The cadence cannot be derived without treating an administrative label as a
      measurement, the repository is unstable, or no candidate has a bounded complete
      discriminator.
    fallback: >-
      Publish the unresolved cadence or stability blocker and keep BC-346 as the sole
      handoff rather than authorizing research.
    outcome: >-
      A conservative count reaches eight substantive non-W5 blocks since Session
      116/BC-322, so OR-12 makes BC-340 mandatory. The scientific portfolio remains
      intact behind W5: Route A at 3.84 is the presumptive first choice, Route S is its
      admission fallback, Route E remains in the first tier, and every other candidate
      has a named resume condition.

    - docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-14-n11-w10-route-selection.md
    - packing/campaign/agendas/agenda-033-overnight-owner-geometry.md
    - packing/campaign/agendas/agenda-036-n11-strategy-reset-roadmap.md
    stop_reason: >-
      The route selection and all alternative dispositions are durable; exact-revision
      certification remains the only unfinished part of BC-346.
    next_action: >-
      Complete BC-346 under think-9y7p by certifying this planning source before
      advancing the current handoff to BC-340.
  progress:
    metric: >-
      Audited candidate entries with an explicit disposition and one selected next
      block, constrained by the measured efficiency cadence and merge stability.
    before: >-
      Ten scientific candidates had an advisory order, BC-340 was tentative, the latest
      qualifying W5 was misclassified in one agenda, and no route had execution
      authority.
    after: >-
      The cadence is derived at the mandatory eight-block ceiling; the latest W5's
      agenda classification is repaired; BC-340 is selected pending certification; and
      all scientific routes remain explicitly continued or paused for the fresh W10
      under BC-353/think-d3h5 that follows W5.
  delegations:
  - task: >-
      Reconstruct the OR-12 cadence from agenda cells, sessions, and measured gate
      receipts and decide whether W5 is due.
    operator: Codex cadence-audit sub-agent, read-only
    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    phase: 1
    outcome: >-
      Located Session 116/BC-322 as the latest substantive W5, found the agenda workflow
      misclassification, and derived a conservative count of eight later non-W5 blocks.

    files: []
    checks:
    - >-
      Excluded administrative work, stopped placeholders, and overlapping Session 125
      from the decisive count.
    uncertainty: Counting Session 125 would raise the count to nine and cannot change the decision.
    elapsed_seconds: null
    elapsed_quality: unavailable
    next_action: Select BC-340 and repair BC-322's agenda workflow classification.
  - task: >-
      Compare the ten scientific candidate cells by payoff, readiness, complete first
      discriminator, stop rule, information transfer, and cost.
    operator: Codex route-matrix sub-agent, read-only
    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    phase: 1
    outcome: >-
      Recommended Route A at 3.84 as the best scientific first choice and Route S as the
      fallback if a complete Route A admission slice cannot be frozen. Produced a
      bounded discriminator and representation-level kill condition for every route.

    checks:
    - Distinguished planning judgment from measured success probability and method-wide verdict.
    uncertainty: The ranking has not been calibrated as a success probability.
    elapsed_seconds: null
    elapsed_quality: unavailable
    next_action: Reconsider Route A first in the fresh W10 after BC-340 closes.
  - task: >-
      Review the recent merged pull requests, origin/main, hosted checks, and retained
      operational debt for any condition that should block planning or research.
    operator: Codex recent-PR stability sub-agent, read-only
    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    phase: 1
    outcome: >-
      Confirmed the planning base equals origin/main at the PR 172 merge and that the
      recent PR checks and post-merge Certificate page are green. The post-merge main
      Packing validation was still running at the source cutoff, so no scientific
      execution is authorized before it resolves and W10 itself merges green.
    evidence:
    - docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-14-n11-w10-route-selection.md
    files: []
    checks:
    - Compared PRs 156, 157, 161–167, and 172; inspected the current main workflow state.
    uncertainty: The full main run had not reached a terminal result at the source cutoff.
    elapsed_seconds: null
    elapsed_quality: unavailable
    next_action: Recheck the full main run before the W10 merge and start no scientific block meanwhile.

  - Eight conservative substantive non-W5 blocks follow the latest qualifying W5 in Session 116/BC-322.
  - Closing BC-346 releases only BC-340; BC-353 blocks every scientific candidate until W5 closes.
  - No efficiency repair or scientific target ran.

  resource_rollups: []
  stop_reason: >-
    The source-bound cadence, stability review, route matrix, and single W5 selection
    are durable. Native task-tree usage is unavailable and was not reconstructed.
  next_action: >-
    Complete BC-346 under think-9y7p by certifying this planning source; the durable W10
    review owns the selected subsequent checkpoint and its separate pull-request boundary.

# N11 W10 Route Selection

This session records the W10 block that follows the checked research-state roll-up and
mathematical audit. The durable review owns the reasoning; this record owns the block
boundary, delegations, certification status, and next handoff.
