  title: Small-n Significant-Progress Mathematical Audit
  date: '2026-09-14'
  started_at: '2026-09-14T21:11:42Z'
  deadline_at: '2026-09-14T22:41:42Z'
  ended_at: '2026-09-14T22:05:32Z'
  branch: codex/synopsis-research-rollup
  primary_bead: think-oj12
  status: stopped
  goal: >-
    Audit the retained n=11 and small-n mathematical record for approaches capable of a
    theorem-sized advance, distinguish those approaches from incremental refinements,
    enlarge the candidate set without duplicating existing work, and hand one disciplined
    portfolio to W10 for selection.
  resource_usage_unmeasured:
    reason: native_harness_data_unavailable
    detail: >-
      The collaboration harness exposed the delegated results but no native task-tree
      resource receipt or log identifier from which the repository roll-up can be
      generated.
    disposition_bead: think-oj12
    handoff_role: work_handoff
  budget:
    wall_minutes: 90
    max_cycles: 3
    orientation_minutes: 10
    checkpoint_minutes: 30
    slice_minutes: 45
    finalization_minutes: 15
  stop_conditions:
  - >-
    Every serious route has a bounded first discriminator, imported premises, payoff,
    transfer value, and continue or park rule, with evidence status explicit.
  - >-
    Additional routes are checked against existing hypotheses and tbd work before new
    tasks are created; no duplicate hypothesis is registered.
  - >-
    The audit recommends priorities but does not select or run a scientific target.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: factual-review
    focus: correctness
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    commitment: BC-347
    objective: >-
      Reconstruct the mathematical boundary and challenge the premises and scope of
      Routes A, S, B, C, and D against the retained proofs and scoped negatives.
    status: completed
    entered_by: session_start
    switch_reason: null
    budget_minutes: 40
    started_at: '2026-09-14T21:11:42Z'
    deadline_at: '2026-09-14T21:51:42Z'
    expected_output: >-
      A source-bound account of what each route can prove, what it currently assumes,
      and which apparent shortcuts fail under the retained evidence.
    validation_command: >-
      cd packing && uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m
      devtools.check_math_spans
      ../docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-14-small-n-significant-progress-mathematical-audit.md
    kill_condition: >-
      A ranking cannot be separated from unsupported probability claims or depends on a
      premise contradicted by a retained exact witness.
    fallback: >-
      Publish only the source-bound corrections and leave the route ordering unresolved
      for W10.
    outcome: >-
      The review retained the exact n11 bracket and fractional ceiling, corrected Route
      A's 3.84 versus 3.85 premises, gave Route S a geometric complexity target, required
      a matched threshold baseline for B, quantified C's angular-bin loss, and separated
      D's proposer control from verifier replay.
    evidence:
    - docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-14-small-n-significant-progress-mathematical-audit.md
    stop_reason: >-
      The factual boundary and the five original route corrections were complete, so the
      audit moved to new mechanisms and portfolio ordering.
    next_action: Add genuinely distinct candidates and check them against existing tracked work.
  - workflow: insight-iteration
    focus: insight
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    commitment: BC-347
    bead: think-oj12
    objective: >-
      Generate and prioritize additional theorem-sized mechanisms, then route them to
      new or existing work without authorizing execution.
    status: stopped
    entered_by: evidence_checkpoint
    switch_reason: >-
      The original route audit exposed reusable angular-capacity, stronger-charge,
      small-n endpoint, and geometric-accounting directions that required explicit
      comparison and tracking.
    budget_minutes: 35
    started_at: '2026-09-14T21:51:42Z'
    deadline_at: '2026-09-14T22:26:42Z'
    expected_output: >-
      An enlarged advisory order, exact first discriminators, duplicate-work decisions,
      a durable review, and a single W10 handoff.
    validation_command: >-
      cd packing && uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev packing-validate --fast
    kill_condition: >-
      A proposed route merely renames an existing incremental lane, cannot identify a
      complete first discriminator, or silently promotes an unmeasured idea to a result.
    fallback: >-
      Retain the five original routes and record rejected additions with their duplicate
      or scope reason.
    outcome: >-
      The audit added global angular resources, stronger charge algebra,
      geometry-dependent joint-parent budgets, an n12 exact-value program, and
      geometric waste accounting. A separate roadmap review found that the angular,
      charge-algebra, joint-parent-budget, and waste routes need explicit current-strategy
      owners, while n12 reuses H-039 and think-0z9b. The advisory order is A, S, angular
      resources, B, stronger charge algebra, geometry-dependent budgets, n12, C, D, then
      geometric waste.
    evidence:
    - docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-14-small-n-significant-progress-mathematical-audit.md
    - packing/campaign/agendas/agenda-036-n11-strategy-reset-roadmap.md
    stop_reason: >-
      The enlarged portfolio, duplication decisions, and W10 decision frame are durable;
      exact-revision certification remains the only open part of the audit block.
    next_action: >-
      Complete BC-347 under think-oj12 by certifying the audit checkpoint before W10
      selects any execution route.
  progress:
    metric: >-
      Serious research approaches with explicit evidence status, relative priority,
      bounded discriminator, and nonduplicative owner.
    before: >-
      Five shaped routes had uneven premises and no common mathematical audit; additional
      mechanisms and other small-n targets had not been compared in one decision frame.
    after: >-
      Ten candidate cells across nine route families have an advisory order and explicit
      first tests; four original route contracts were corrected; n12 reuses existing
      tracking; four additions receive explicit current-strategy tasks; and W10 remains
      the sole selection authority.
  delegations:
  - task: >-
      Perform a deep source-bound mathematical audit of the five shaped routes, propose
      distinct additional approaches, and rank them for significant n11 or small-n
      progress.
    operator: Astra Max mathematical-strategy sub-agent, read-only
    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    phase: 1
    outcome: >-
      Produced the route corrections, new derivations, four additional mechanisms,
      transfer controls, and W10 decision frame retained in the durable audit.
    evidence:
    - docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-14-small-n-significant-progress-mathematical-audit.md

    checks: [Flowmark passed, every repository-relative link resolved, and all 102 mathematical spans parsed.]
    uncertainty: The ranking is a reasoned allocation judgment, not a measured success probability.
    elapsed_seconds: null
    elapsed_quality: unavailable
    next_action: W10 should select one bounded execution entry from the audited set.
  - task: >-
      Check the additional routes against agenda, hypothesis, and tbd ownership and
      recommend exact nonduplicative roadmap wiring.
    operator: Codex roadmap-integration sub-agent, read-only
    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    phase: 2
    outcome: >-
      Distinguished Route E from orientation structure, separated Route F1's stronger
      charge algebra from Route F2's geometry-dependent joint-parent budget, mapped Route
      N to H-039 and think-0z9b, and confirmed Route G as a new speculative candidate.
      F1 relates to think-yc80 and think-g3j7 but neither existing bead owns its complete
      discriminator. No new hypothesis was warranted before W10.
    evidence:
    - packing/campaign/agendas/agenda-036-n11-strategy-reset-roadmap.md
    files: []
    checks: [Compared the audit with X-014, X-027, X-030, H-039, H-131, and live tbd ownership.]
    uncertainty: W10 still has to price admission work and reconstruct whether W5 is due.
    elapsed_seconds: null
    elapsed_quality: unavailable
    next_action: Retain recommendations as tentative agenda entries until W10 disposes them.

  checks:
  - The scientific evidence boundary remains origin/main revision 80bcdbb0819504354e1278c37f211dd8cc2158fb.
  - Astra Max distinguished proved facts, new analytical deductions, planning judgments, and speculation and ran no scientific target.
  - Route S's upward 1/30000 weight-rounding recipe remains below budget eleven; it is an analytical recipe, not a produced certificate.
  - The roadmap-duplication review created no new hypothesis, reused existing tbd ownership for Route N, and separated new current-strategy ownership for Routes F1 and F2 from related legacy work.
  - 'full gate: fast at fa6363b6c2b4c7d7449807c04166e9df94bc7b35: passed'
  - The qualifying local run used the declared four-CPU reference shape and passed all 63 fast-surface steps in 459.37 seconds.
  resource_rollups: []
  stop_reason: >-
    The source-bound audit, enlarged portfolio, duplication decisions, and W10 frame are
    durable and certified at the recorded exact revision. Native task-tree usage is
    unavailable and was not reconstructed.
  next_action: >-
    Run BC-346 under think-9y7p as the separate planning block; select no scientific
    target before that block records its disposition.

# Small-n Significant-Progress Mathematical Audit

This session records the mathematical audit block that follows the research-state
roll-up and precedes W10 planning.
The durable review contains the reasoning; this record owns the block boundary, agent
handoff, resource-measurement limitation, and certification status.
