  branch: codex/synopsis-research-rollup
  primary_bead: think-uqa4
  status: stopped
  goal: >-
    Reconcile the post-merge research program into a source-first synopsis snapshot,
    make the roll-up repeatable and checked, route README and the active plans through
    it, and hand a separate mathematical audit one explicit candidate set before W10
    makes the execution choice.
  resource_usage_unmeasured:
    reason: native_harness_data_unavailable
    detail: >-
      This Codex desktop continuation exposes no native task-tree resource receipt or
      log identifier from which the repository roll-up can be generated.

    orientation_minutes: 20
    checkpoint_minutes: 30
    slice_minutes: 60
    finalization_minutes: 30
  stop_conditions:
  - >-
    The source records, generated views, synopsis status and handoff, README navigation,
    and active plans agree, or every remaining conflict is named without choosing prose
    over its owning record.
  - >-
    The roll-up procedure and drift check are durable repository tools rather than an
    unrepeatable inventory assembled only for this session.
  - >-
    No scientific target runs and no paused registration receives a positive or negative
    verdict from an administrative strategy decision.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: pipeline-improvement
    focus: process
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    commitment: BC-339
    objective: >-
      Build the source-first roll-up contract, drift checker, and observed terminal-time
      rule needed to keep one synopsis account current.

    deadline_at: '2026-09-14T20:58:00Z'
    expected_output: >-
      A durable roll-up contract, source-derived synopsis status check, terminal-session
      ordering rule, and focused negative controls.
    validation_command: >-
      cd packing && uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev pytest -q
      tests/test_synopsis_handoff.py
    kill_condition: >-
      The checker cannot derive a dimension from its owning source without duplicating
      source semantics or silently trusting a stale generated view.
    fallback: >-
      Narrow the checked block to directly owned fields and leave any uncheckable
      synthesis visibly unresolved.
    outcome: >-
      W8 now defines cutoff, fact-specific ownership, counting, conflict, and validation
      rules; check_synopsis derives the marked program snapshot; and new terminal
      sessions record observed end times instead of treating deadlines as outcomes.

    stop_reason: >-
      The pipeline contract and regression surface are implemented; the work then moved
      to the reader-document reconciliation they support.
    next_action: >-
      Reconcile the source records, generated views, synopsis, README, and active plans
      under the W8 documentation-pass contract.

      Reconcile the post-merge research inventory and strategy reset into one checked
      synopsis account, with README and active plans routing through it.
    status: stopped
    entered_by: evidence_checkpoint
    switch_reason: >-
      The roll-up contract and checker were established, so the remaining work was the
      source-first reader-document reconciliation governed by W8.

    expected_output: >-
      Reconciled source records and generated views, a checked synopsis snapshot, README
      navigation, current roadmap agenda, and one unambiguous planning handoff.
    validation_command: >-
      cd packing && uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev packing-validate --fast
    kill_condition: >-
      An owning source cannot be reconciled without changing scientific evidence or the
      selected roadmap beyond the owner’s stated strategy reset.
    fallback: >-
      Retain the source conflict, file a defect, and leave the prior current-state claim
      visibly unresolved rather than synthesizing an unsupported answer.
    outcome: >-
      The source records now distinguish registered-but-unrun H-160/H-162 work from
      scientific results; agenda036 separates this roll-up from the next planning block;
      the synopsis owns one checked current account; and README and the active plans
      route through it.

    stop_reason: >-
      The source reconciliation and reader routing are implemented; merge certification
      remains the only open part of this block.
    next_action: >-
      Complete BC-339 under think-uqa4 by certifying the handed-over source before
      changing the current handoff to the mathematical audit.
  progress:
    metric: >-
      Reader-facing program dimensions reconciled to source records and protected by a
      repeatable pipeline.
    before: >-
      The synopsis date and current handoff predated the merged stack and owner strategy
      reset; H-160 and H-162 appeared running without a target receipt; the README did
      not route to a program-status account; and W8 had no exact roll-up procedure.
    after: >-
      Seven program dimensions have source-derived snapshot rows; the current bracket,
      agenda/session/exploration arc, paused lanes, five research routes, and handoff are
      reconciled; README routes rather than duplicates; and the next two blocks are
      explicitly mathematical audit and planning rather than research execution.

    outcome: >-
      Identified the stale date, hypothesis totals, current handoff, later historical
      synthesis, and the existing checker as the correct enforcement surface.

    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    phase: 1

    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    phase: 2
    outcome: >-
      Corrected volatile duplication, source ownership, W7/W8 boundaries, W5

  - Three independent read-only audits agreed that W8 owns the roll-up process, SYNOPSIS owns current synthesis, README owns navigation, and W10 owns the next selection.
  - Live tbd state was synchronized at 2026-09-14T21:22:58Z; think-oj12 depends on think-uqa4, think-9y7p depends on think-oj12, and every execution candidate depends on think-9y7p.
  - TUTORIAL.md, conventions.md, operating-rules.md, and development.md were checked against the reconciled state; their stable contracts remain current and need no change.
  - The focused lifecycle, session-clock, handoff, and campaign suites passed 89 tests after the new stale-count and terminal-time negative controls were added; Ruff passed every modified Python file.
  - No scientific target ran; exp-158 and exp-160 have zero target wall seconds and administrative blocked dispositions.

# Session 128 — Checked Research-State Roll-Up Pipeline

This session treats the roll-up as pipeline work.
It changes the records and reader surfaces, adds a drift check, and defines a repeatable
W8 procedure. It does not use the documentation pass as a scientific experiment or infer
a verdict from the owner’s strategy reset.

The next block is deliberately separate: BC-347 is a read-only Astra Max mathematical
audit that challenges Routes A, B, S, C, and D and adds materially distinct candidates.
BC-346 follows as the W10 block that determines whether the efficiency checkpoint is due
and selects exactly one bounded execution entry from the audited set.
