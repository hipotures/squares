# Attribution and source identity

The release extends established weighted-covering, strict-core transport and
exact geometric-sweep methods. It does not claim independent invention of
those methods or an exhaustive literature-priority result.

## Mira / 17squares

The numerical support and parent-angle catalogue lineage comes from
[Mira-acc/17squares at ac464dd](https://github.com/Mira-acc/17squares/tree/ac464dd06ded72e2f6eb2c2f3d510b01391c056d),
specifically `certificates/lower_bound_4p614153/certificate.json` with SHA-256
`5ffb7746fb8aa8d436256710a035235436eecc5e6cfeca3d150dc01b18b801c3`.
The pinned source attribution is retained in `NOTICES/Mira-ATTRIBUTION.md`.
The original upstream certificate and source code are not bundled here.

Our certificate changes and enlarges the spatial support, introduces weighted
two-of-three site charges, changes weights, and refines the angle catalogue.
Its final geometry and weights are exact rational data and are checked afresh.

## Guzhou0806 / N17 project

The audited baseline is
[R038 at 32edfd3](https://github.com/Guzhou0806/n17-square-packing/tree/32edfd3da78bf80a309398f552b3b602b9c45d6c/certificates/R038),
published by **Guzhou0806 / N17 project, with AI assistance**. R038 reports
the strict lower bound `461300000000/99974999999`. Its parent-side reduction,
strict containment and expanded-centre-domain replay are part of this
continuation's direct lineage.

The secondary checker adapts R038's
[`src/exact_parent_side_scan.js`](https://github.com/Guzhou0806/n17-square-packing/blob/32edfd3da78bf80a309398f552b3b602b9c45d6c/certificates/R038/src/exact_parent_side_scan.js).
We added support for the finer coordinate denominator, point-orbit format,
weighted two-of-three rectangles, generalized input identity and budget checks.
The distributed adaptation contains this project's edits; unchanged upstream
source is fetched locally from the pinned public revision.

## Joshua Levy / the squares project

Credit **Joshua Levy, the squares project
([github.com/jlevy/squares](https://github.com/jlevy/squares))** for the
weighted-covering, strict-core, event-cell and threshold-budget lineage
documented by the upstream projects. An explicitly cited antecedent is the
[parent-centre contract](https://github.com/jlevy/squares/blob/fb14f5174fdf675b296b442c98b7127fccc8a84d/packing/cases/n11_five_dot_cover/unit-parent-centre-contract.md).
The upstream attribution also identifies Levy's
[threshold certificate](https://github.com/jlevy/squares/blob/main/packing/cases/n11_threshold_certificate/t-025-verifiable-claim-191-50.md).

The upstream MIT notice and the archived code/documentation licence distinction
are retained in `NOTICES/Joshua-Levy-MIT.txt` and
`NOTICES/Joshua-Levy-LICENSE-source.txt`. Those grants do not license unrelated
third-party works or extend to Guzhou/Mira material merely by association.

## The established packing

The upper-bound construction is a rational reconstruction of the established
[Bidwell 17-square packing](https://kingbird.myphotos.cc/packing/square-17.svg).
We verified the supplied rational coordinates exactly. This is not a newly
discovered packing and does not improve that established construction.

## This continuation

The new milestone is the certificate for `s(17) > 461300/99853`, together with
the exact charge argument, the independently written Python polygon-edge
checker, the adapted secondary checker, independent premise controls and
completed verification records. Numerical optimization and AI exploration
found the input; they are not premises of the proof. The human/AI division of
work is explained in [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md).
