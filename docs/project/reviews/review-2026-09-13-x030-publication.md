# X-030 Final Publication Review at `147ceff6`

## Scope and Disposition

Read-only review of clean committed head `147ceff6a5d333302eb339b3527b7a17ff52dd9e` on
`codex/n11-post-t1-strategy-exploration`, focused on the three corrections from the
`bfceca46` review and the resulting factual status of X-030, the active plan, and the
ideas index. No source files were edited and no scientific target was run.

**Disposition: publication-ready on factual scope.** All three prior findings are
resolved. No new content finding arose from the three-file correction diff.
This is a content review; it does not certify exact-head validation, push state, or
hosted CI.

## Correction Check

| Prior finding | Resolution at `147ceff6` |
| --- | --- |
| Ideas index treated the literal parent mass as unmeasured | `packing/campaign/ideas.md:552–554` now gives exp-159’s `N=4000015`, says T2 C/S target charges remain unrun, and says X-030 registers no additional target or bound. These match the retained exp-159 receipt, H-160 `instrument_ready: false`, exp-158 `results: []`, and X-030 `proposes: []`. |
| Plan promised verified native usage and scientific runtime for every stacked PR | `docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-09-10-n11-daytime-strategy-and-explainer.md:629–632` now requires only evidence verified for each layer, with exclusions and unattributed usage explicit. This accommodates H-161’s 0.16-second target receipt without inventing branch-only native usage, and the T2 task-time lower bound without inventing a charge run. |
| Historical parent-union review used present tense for unmeasured mass | `docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-13-bc303-parent-union-math.md:10` now ties the uncomputed status to that review’s T1 cutoff. It no longer conflicts with the later H-161 result. |

## Status and Boundaries

X-030 still reports the H-161 literal result at `N=4000015` and four-corner union
`16000060`, with `1048233` units of slack in both necessary comparisons.
It does not infer an eleven-parent extension, pose-cell exclusion, owner-selection
theorem, or new `s(11)` bound.
The C filter requires at least `4524200`; a lower C result needs exact physical-parent
replay before the opposite/combined helper is rejected.
The S first-owner sufficient filter requires at least `4524185`; a lower strip cell
rejects only that filter.
The plan’s rank 2T lane preserves one registered target run after target-head source and
readiness checks, and still leaves global availability open.

The plan retains the explicit V3 source caveat at lines 646–649. The correction diff
adds no link or frontmatter path, and `git diff --check bfceca46..147ceff6` is clean.
The prior exact-head records pass at `bfceca46` checked 32/74 selected steps and links;
validation of `147ceff6` and hosted checks remain outside this review.
